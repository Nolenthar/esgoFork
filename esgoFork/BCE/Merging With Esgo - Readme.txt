The following rules apply for all pre-merged mod.

1 - What is Pre-Merged Mod ?

The Witcher 3 modding involves a lot of scripts base mod. Those scripts often alter the same file. Merging those may be tricky, and it generally ends up with neither of the merged mods working correctly.

Pre-Merged Mods are mods, selected for being either extremely good or essential (and popular), where their conflicting content has been pre-merged with ESGO to make it straight forward to play.

2 - How does that work ?

Unless mentionned otherwise, you ALWAYS need to download the original mod. The compatibility folder only contains conflicting files, so the original's author work will not work if you don't download its work, and endorse him for that !

There is no priority to set. I took care of everything for you. If you are using a mods.setting file and have some priority set there, make sure, whatever you do, that you use alphabetical order (file system one) when using my archives.

3 - Install

Copy modEsgo and mod0esgoCompatibilityFiles to your %The Witcher 3%/mods folder

4 - What you shouldn't do

You shouldn't merge anything for the pre-merged mods. If you have another mod conflicting with one of the file the pre-merged mods use, well, you're on your own, sorry. Wait a bit, as more pre-merged mods will be added.
Or kindly request the mod to be supported, I'll do my best
