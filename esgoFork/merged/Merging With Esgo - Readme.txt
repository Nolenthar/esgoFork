The following rules apply for all pre-merged mod.

1 - What is Pre-Merged Mod ?

The Witcher 3 modding involves a lot of scripts base mod. Those scripts often alter the same file. Merging those may be tricky, and it generally ends up with neither of the merged mods working correctly.

Pre-Merged Mods are mods, selected for being either extremely good or essential (and popular), where their conflicting content has been pre-merged with ESGO to make it straight forward to play.

2 - How does that work ?

Unless mentionned otherwise, you ALWAYS need to download the original mod. ESGO only contains the conflicting files. The other author's mod will not work if you don't 	download it.

In order to make priority easy, the priority is ALWAYS the alphabetical priority, as it is how The Witcher 3 loads the mod by default. But you don't have to worry about this, I'm the one doing the worrying for you. So if you don't have any priority set in your mods.setting, or if you don't care, just delete mods.setting, or make sure there is nothing script related there.
The only situation where you'll have to worry about priority, is if you're already using them for another reason. In this case, for ESGO, and the other pre-merged mod you'll install, you need to use the alphabetical priority. 

3 - Install

Make sure you install the Other Mods BEFORE. So, if you're merging with Better Combat Evolved, make sure you have the mod folder for Better Combat Evolved in your mods.
Copy the full content of the archive in your mods folder, overwrite when prompted.
Launch the game ! voila, it works.

4 - What you shouldn't do

You shouldn't merge anything for the pre-merged mods. If you have another mod conflicting with one of the file the pre-merged mods use, well, you're on your own, sorry. Wait a bit, as more pre-merged mods will be added.
